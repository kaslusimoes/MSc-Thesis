Now we can solve this equations for several values of the parameters $(\beta, \delta, \varepsilon)$ and obtain the fixed points of the system. For simplicity we only consider the situation in which the different populations have the same size, that is, $\rho_A = 0.5 = \rho_B$.

From [@fig:phasediagram], beyond the expected behavior of an all-agreeing phase and a disagreement one, we also note that there is a region where both groups present zero magnetization. This can be seen also from the free energy plot, in [@fig:freeenergy], below, and this is due to the interplay between agreement and disagreement in the groups' interactions.
