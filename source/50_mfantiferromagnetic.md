In chapter [@sec:meanfield] the only values of mistrust $\varepsilon$ explored were between $0$ and $0.5$. That is because for values of $\varepsilon > 0.5$ the society enters a frustrated state which cannot be resolved by aligning nor anti-aligning the opinions of the agents. This problem is known for a long time on infinite-range Ising models and can be solved separating the Ising variables into 2 groups. The groups, which we will call *communities*, have ferromagnetic interactions within them and antiferromagnetic ones between elements of different the communities.

In this section we will show how another MF model can be extended using a bipartite model with the possibility antiferromagnetic interactions.
