How can we integrate the fact that sometimes people agree with one another other, and other times disagree on their moral valuations? One can naturally imagine two alternative situations: one in which the whole society agrees on what is considered correct, and one in which chaos reign, because cannot seem to reach a consensus. How is it then that our societies maintain a considerable level of disagreement while still retaining some organization? How can there be a coexistence of variability in opinions with a cohesiveness that enables a society to thrive and develop? In times when we are haunted with cultural and political wars between people with different opinions, one cannot but wonder which are the physical variables that describe this cohesiveness and richness of cultures in a society, and what one can expect about times to come.

On this research it is highly relevant that one does not dismiss the progress already made. For example, here we build upon social psychology works of Jonathan Haidt and collaborators [see e.g. @Haidt2001; @Haidt2010; @Haidt2007] on how humans assess morality. It is also important to consider existing experiments and models from neurophisiology and cognitive neuroscience, specially findings about what forces drive human behaviour or how to categorize and understand human learning. Both areas - social psychology and neuroscience - are deeply related, to the extent that [@Greene2009] says: "[the field of moral neuropsychology] provides a set of useful entry points into the broader problems of complex cognition and decision making". If one wants to understand the brain and human behavior, one ought to attack this problem knowing both endeavours.

As [@Watts2004] says: "no one descends with such fury and in so great a number as a pack of hungry physicists, adrenalized by the scent of a new problem". And with sociophysics it has not been different:

- Talk about how the tools from statmech can help us achieve those goals, because physics rock and inference rock even more!

Models of segregation have been proposed initially by [@Schelling1969; @Schelling1971], models for dissemination of culture [@Axelrod1997] and models for the evolution of cooperation [@Axelrod1981].

- Talk about previous works, even talk about opinion models (maybe their weaknesses?).

- Finish with some questions and ideas that we are going to develop here.
