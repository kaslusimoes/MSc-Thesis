How can we integrate the fact that sometimes people agree on their moral valuations with one another, and other times disagree? One can naturally imagine two alternative situations: one in which the whole society agrees on what is considered correct, and one in which chaos reign, because people cannot seem to reach a consensus. How is it then that our societies maintain a considerable level of disagreement while still retaining some organization? How can there be a coexistence of a variability of opinions and still there be a cohesiveness that enables a society to thrive and develop? In times when we are haunted with cultural and political wars between people with different opinions, one cannot but wonder which are the physical variables that describe this cohesiveness and richness of cultures in a society, and what one can expect about times to come.

In science it is highly relevant that one does not dismiss the progress already made. One of the works we build upon is the line of research of Jonathan Haidt and collaborators about social psychology [see e.g. @Haidt2001; @Haidt2010; @Haidt2007]. It is also important to consider existing experiments and models from neurophysiology and cognitive neuroscience, specially findings about what drives human behaviour or how to categorize and understand human learning. Both areas - social psychology and neuroscience - are deeply related, to the extent that [@Greene2009] says: "[the field of cognitive neuroscience of morality] provides a set of useful entry points into the broader problems of complex cognition and decision making". If one wants to understand the brain and human behavior, one ought to attack this problem knowing both endeavours.

As [@Watts2004] says: "no one descends with such fury and in so great a number as a pack of hungry physicists, adrenalized by the scent of a new problem". And with sociophysics has not been different, one can check [@Castellano2009] for a review of previous attempts to use statistical mechanics in social systems. We present some of those:

- Schelling's models for segregation [@Schelling1969; @Schelling1971];
- Axelrod's models for dissemination of culture [@Axelrod1997] and for the evolution of cooperation [@Axelrod1981];
- Caticha and Vicente's models on social consensus [@Caticha2010], morality and political affiliation descriptions [@Vicente2014; @Caticha2015] and community formation [@Alves2016]

This dissertation fits in the line of work from this last point. The tools used are that of bayesian and entropic inference, statistical physics and machine learning. Bayesian and entropic learning because we are dealing in situations of incomplete information; statistical mechanics because it is a natural extension of the first two and because we it provides us a toolbox of methods to solve the problems encountered (such as mean field, Laplace's method to find a partition function, among other); and machine learning to inform our choice of models.

FINISH WITH SOME QUESTIONS AND IDEAS THAT WE ARE GOING TO DEVELOP HERE.
