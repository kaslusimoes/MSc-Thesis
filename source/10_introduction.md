Here I shall present some introduction to the topics being worked on this dissertation. No idea about hat should be those yet

Well, I have some results about conservatioliberalism vs. extremism that are nice to include somewhere (Felippe convinced me). I also have the MF result presented at the MaxEnt 2017, which definitely I must include (some result :yay). Lastly, I have the "new" MF antiferromagnetic model that I'm solving, which can be nice to include as well.

The MaxEnt result depends on the entropic learning dynamics, so I guess it should be first (because that way I can start explaining prob, maxent, and then show the model). Maybe I should present some MCMC simulations as well? Let's see. Then I can talk about the choice of the Zeitgeist, and present extremism framework. For that I'll need to explain why I defer the MaxEnt model to the ViSuJeCa one. I guess that should be okay. Finally I can recover some distrust/antiferromagnetism with the last MF model. Yay!

Other things I have that I think do not fit in this thesis:

- graphical comparison between line segments and  tightness (same thing I "showed" Peter L and Gatsby);
- unfinished comparison between beta and tightness for different countries and political affiliations (maybe..? :sadface );
- unfinished analysis of the convincement problem

For the line segment/tightness thing, recall that I'm using the moralmatrix.csv file, not the whole data MFQ.csv. Also, instead of using some "arbitrary" 2 vectors from the data by hand, I can calculate the correlation matrix of it and take the 2 eigenvectors with greatest eigenvalues, can't I?
