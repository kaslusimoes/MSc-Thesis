How can we integrate the fact that sometimes people agree with one another other, and other times disagree on their moral valuations? One can naturally imagine two alternative situations: one in which the whole society agrees on what is considered correct, and one in which chaos reign, because cannot seem to reach a consensus. How is it then that our societies maintain a considerable level of disagreement while still retaining some organization? How can there be a coexistence of variability in opinions with a cohesiveness that enables a society to thrive and develop? In times when we are haunted with cultural and political wars between people with different opinions, one cannot but wonder which are the physical variables that describe this cohesiveness and richness of cultures in a society, and what one can expect about times to come.

On this research it is highly relevant that one does not dismiss the progress already made in fields such as psychology, neuroscience and anthropology. Jonathan Haidt and collaborators have published several works [@Haidt2001; @Haidt2010; @Haidt2007] studying

- Introduce some Haidt and Psychology

Although Haidt's _moral intuitionist_ model has its drawbacks and shortcomings [@Pizarro2003], it is already clear that emotions are important when assessing morality (something from [@Greene2009]).

This problem is relevant to the understanding of the human mind to the extent that [@Greene2009] says: "[the field of moral neuropsychology] provides a set of useful entry points into the broader problems of complex cognition and decision making".

- Talk about how the tools from statmech can help us achieve those goals, because physics rock and inference rock even more!

Models of segregation have been proposed initially by [@Schelling1969; @Schelling1971], models for dissemination of culture [@Axelrod1997] and models for the evolution of cooperation [@Axelrod1981].

- Talk about previous works, even talk about opinion models (maybe their weaknesses?).

- Finish with some questions and ideas that we are going to develop here.
