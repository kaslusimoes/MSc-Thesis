Talk about how it is important that we study societies, introduce some concepts, some Haidt etc

Talk about how the tools from statmech can help us achieve those goals, because physics rock and inference rock even more!

Talk about previous works, even talk about opinion models (maybe their weaknesses?).

Finish with some questions and ideas that we are going to develop here.

Finish with an outline of this thesis

OLD ABSTRACT:

We model a society of agents who interact in pairs by exchanging for/against opinions about issues using a perceptron algorithm. Employing a maximum entropy analysis one can describe the interacting pair as a dynamics along the gradient of the logarithm of the evidence. This permits introducing an energy like quantity and an approximate global Hamiltonian. Knowledge of the expected value of the Hamiltonian is relevant information for the state of the society, inducing a canonical distribution by maximum entropy. We study the phase diagram of the society using a mean field approximation which indicate a phase transitions separating ordered and disordered phases depending on the society parameters.
