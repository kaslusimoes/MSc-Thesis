## Antiferromagnetic Interaction {#sec:mfantiferromagnetic}

One can note that in the previous MF analysis we only explore values of mistrust between $0$ and $0.5$. That is because for values of $\varepsilon > 0.5$ the society enters a frustrated state which cannot be resolved aligning nor anti-aligning the opinions. This problem is known for a long time on infinite-range Ising models and can be solved separating the Ising variables into 2 groups which have ferromagnetic interactions within them and antiferromagnetic ones between elements of different the groups.

In this section we will show how the MF approximation performed in section [@sec:mfcalculation] can be extended using the same reasoning deployed to solve the bipartite antiferromagnetic Ising model.
