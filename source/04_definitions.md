# Definitions {#sec:definitions .unnumbered}

That's enough for now, but the spacing between the name of the thing being defined and the defiition should be the same throughout the whole definition list.. maybe I should use another procedure, more LaTeX-like

$\mathbf{x}$

: variable being inferred

$y$

: data being used to infer $\mathbf{x}$

student

: the folk inferring something

$\mathcal{Z}$

: partition function or Zeitgeist?
