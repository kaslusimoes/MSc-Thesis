## Social Influence {#sec:socialinfluence}

Human beings are social [@Baumeister1995] and our social interactions constrain and define us and our beliefs. Here we show some psychological and neurological evidence to support that claim.

### Psychology of Conformity {#sec:psychconformity}

For many the pioneer of social psychology experiments, Sherif dedicated himself to the study of _attitudes_ and _social influence_. In particular, one of his first articles studied what he called  "the daily phenomena of suggestion (…) in the formation of attitudes" [@Sherif1937 pg. 98]. On that experiment participants had to perform the same visual task twice: at the first trial they did it in pairs; and individually, in a second trial. What Sherif noted was twofold:

- During the first trial, there is a norm (standard) and a range of responses that are established within the group, and subjects typically update their responses to conform to the group;
- This conformity is retained when the subject comes back to the second trial, several days later, showing that this kind of influence has lasting effects on the subject.

So far several clarifications and further results have been obtained as well. We present some of those for completeness of this exposition

First, [@Deutsch1955] makes a distinction between 2 kinds of influences: _"normative"_ ("influence to conform with the positive expectations of another") and _"informational"_ ("an influence to accept information obtained from another as evidence about reality"). This distinction is important because we can have settings in which subjects do not feel as belonging to a particular group - therefore they are not subject to a normative influence - and yet they can be influenced in an "informational" way when they consider their peers to be a "trustworthy source of information about the objective reality". [^psychwiki]

Around the same time, [@Asch1956] set out to study the effect of _majorities_ on the opinion of other participants of a group. They performed a visual task with groups of 7-9 individuals, of which only one had not met previously with the experimenter. Those, called confederates, were set respond the task with a previously established strategy: the idea was that the majority could, after setting a baseline of trust with correct answers, dissuade the subject to give an incorrect answer. The results obtained were mixed: as Asch puts it, "the performances ranged from complete independence to complete acquiescence", and "one-third of the minority estimates were distorted toward the majority".

We argue that both social comparisons to reduce uncertainty and the existence of normative pressure to comply depend on perceiving the source of influence as belonging to one's own category

Taken together the experiments show that self-categorization can be a crucial determining factor in social influence

Results from the three experiments suggest that self-categorization can be a crucial determining factor in social influence, and that the extent of informational and normative influence may depend very largely upon whether the source of influence is regarded as a member of a person's own category.

<!-- Como estudado experimentalmente em [4], os dois tipos de influências interpessoais (normativa e informacional) dependem de que os indivíduos se percebam como membros do grupo. Para isso os autores do estudo refizeram os experimentos de Sherif e Asch com a diferença de que à noção de pertencimento de grupo dos participantes era salientada. Com isso, eles sugerem que os tipos de influência social interpessoal são casos particulares de influência referente informativa quando o indivíduo tem completa noção de pertencimento ao grupo. -->
To give one last perspective, [@Abrams1990] gathered experimental setups from several authors (Sherif and Asch among them) and studied those setups giving a closer look to _categorization_ (self and of others). Their study showed how the membership of some subject's peers modulated the influence they had on the subject's response. Among other things, they concluded that, for both informational and normative influences, _self-categorization_ had a crucial contribution to the conformity behaviour. In other words: defining the group to which I belong and realizing my peers belong to the same group (or do not) are necessary to make me trust them and take their opinions for granted (or not).

### Neuroscience of Exclusion {#sec:neuroexclusion}

We also have evidence from neuroscience [@Eisenberger2003] explaining how is it that _social pain_ [^socialpain] experiences recruit the same neural machinery employed during physical pain ones. Several participants had to play a virtual game in which they experienced being socially rejected by other peers in 2 different situations: first in an implicit event and then an explicit exclusion scenario. In both cases the researches found a distinguished fMRI signal in two regions: dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (_dACC_) and right ventral prefrontal cortex (_RVPFC_).

In fact, growing number of research is surfacing the importance of this interplay between physical and social distress. [@Eisenberger2004] says that social support in humans even "increases tolerance to electric shock stimulation [@44] and decreases levels of self-repeated pain during cold-pressor task [@45]". A recent review by [@Eisenberger2012] analyses those claims in more depth and has pointers to further evidence for the interested reader.
