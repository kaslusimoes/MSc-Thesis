Human beings are social [@Baumeister1995] and our social interactions constrain and define us and our beliefs. Here we show some psychological and neurological evidence to support that claim.

### Psychology of Conformity {#sec:psychconformity}

For many the pioneer of social psychology experiments, Sherif dedicated himself to the study of attitudes and social influence. In particular, one of his first articles studied what he called  "the daily phenomena of suggestion (…) in the formation of attitudes" [@Sherif1937 pg. 98]. On that experiment participants had to perform the same visual task twice: at the first trial they did it in pairs; and individually, in a second trial. What Sherif noted was twofold:

- During the first trial, there is a norm (standard) and a range of responses that are established within the group, and subjects typically update their responses to conform to the group;
- This conformity is retained when the subject comes back to the second trial, several days later, showing that this kind of influence has lasting effects on the subject.

So far several clarifications and further results have been obtained as well. We present 3 for completeness of this exposition

First, [@Deutsch1955] makes a distinction between 2 kinds of influences: _"normative"_ ("influence to conform with the positive expectations of another") and _"informational"_ ("an influence to accept information obtained from another as evidence about reality"). This distinction is important because we can have settings in which subjects do not feel as belonging to a particular group - therefore they are not subject to a normative influence - and yet they can be influenced in an "informational" way when they consider their peers to be a "trustworthy source of information about the objective reality". [^psychwiki]

Around the same time, [@Asch1956] set out to study the effect of majorities on the opinion of other participants of a group. They performed a visual task with groups of 7-9 individuals, of which only one had not met previously with the experimenter to respond the task with previously established responses. The idea was that the majority could, after setting a baseline of trust with correct answers, dissuade the subject to give an incorrect answer. The results obatined were mixed: as Asch puts it, "the performances ranged from complete independence to complete acquiescence", and "one-third of the minority estimates were distorted toward the majority".

We argue that both social comparisons to reduce uncertainty and the existence of normative pressure to comply depend on perceiving the source of influence as belonging to one's own category

Taken together the experiments show that self-categorization can be a crucial determining factor in social influence

Results from the three experiments suggest that self-categorization can be a crucial determining factor in social influence, and that the extent of informational and normative influence may depend very largely upon whether the source of influence is regarded as a member of a person's own category.

<!-- Como estudado experimentalmente em [4], os dois tipos de influências interpessoais (normativa e informacional) dependem de que os indivíduos se percebam como membros do grupo. Para isso os autores do estudo refizeram os experimentos de Sherif e Asch com a diferença de que à noção de pertencimento de grupo dos participantes era salientada. Com isso, eles sugerem que os tipos de influência social interpessoal são casos particulares de influência referente informativa quando o indivíduo tem completa noção de pertencimento ao grupo. -->
To give one last perspective, [@Abrams1990] gathered insights from the work of several authors (Sherif and Asch among them) and studied those experimental setups giving a closer look to categorization (self and of others). Their study showed how the membership of some subject's group peers modulated the influence they had on their response. Among many other things, they concluded that, for both informational and normative influences, self-categorization had a crucial contribution to the conformity behaviour.

### Neuroscience of Exclusion {#sec:neuroexclusion}

From a more contemporary perspective, we also have results from neuroscience explaining how is it that social estrangement causes real physical pain [@Eisenberger2003; @Eisenberger2004; @Eisenberger2012].
