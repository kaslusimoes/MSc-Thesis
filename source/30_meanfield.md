A possible strategy to study a society of the agents developed in section [@sec:bayesgaussperceptron] is to define conserved quantities - such as the Hamiltonian associated with the interaction potential of those agents - and proceed with the usual Statistical Mechanics tools. At some point the calculation might become intractable and that is when one must transition to approximate results and/or computational methods. In this section we develop a Mean Field approach to an specific canonical ensemble of social agents in a noisy society.
