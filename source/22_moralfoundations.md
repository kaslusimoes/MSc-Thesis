How do people assess morality in everyday life? This has been more recently been investigated extensively by Haidt and collaborators [a nice explanation can be found in @Haidt2007]. We outline some of their conclusions below.

In [@Haidt2001] was proposed that moral judgment is not a consequence of moral reasoning, but of "quick, automatic evaluations (_intuitions_)". According to this proposal moral reasoning "is an effortful process, engaged in after a moral judgment is made, in which a person searches for arguments that will support an already-made judgment" (pg. 818)

Although there are well-stated criticisms [@Pizarro2003] toward Haidt's _moral intuitionist_ model, it is already clear that emotions and intuitions are primordial when humans make moral judgments (cite something from [@Greene2009]). This is important to us because it is easier to model intuitive mechanisms of the brain than more elaborate ones. This also inform us that the action and reaction to moral assertions is prompt and immediate.

Also from this line of research, they found support for the idea that the human mind comes equipped with 5 modules [@Haidt2004, at the time they thought to be only 4] to judge morality: Harm, Fairness (the ones agreed upon throughout academic community), Loyalty, Ingroup/Authority and Purity/Sanctity (there is a discussion whether Liberty should be included to account for the libertarian movement [@Iyer2012]). This is now known as the ***Moral Foundations Theory*** (MFT) [@Graham2013].

This is a core pillar to our research because it is what guarantees that the assessment of morality happens within a finite set of dimensions, even if psychologists happen to find more foundations. Morality does not happen in a non-comprehensible infinite space, nor is it an intermingle of "yes or no" output to one-case judgments.

Finally, [@Gilligan2012] developed a "reliable and theoretically-grounded measurement of the full range of moral concerns", the ***Moral Foundations Questionnaire*** (MFQ). It is set of responses people gave stating their opinions on several questions about morality. [^mfqonline] They also labeled themselves with what the researchers called  **political affiliations** (_pa_), which could one of the following take entries: Very Liberal, Liberal, Slightly Liberal, Moderate, Slightly Conservative, Conservative, Very Conservative, Libertarian, Other and Don't know (we disregarded the last 3 categories in our analysis in [@sec:comparisonmfq]).

This research culminated in discovering that people from different political affiliations tend to see moral assertions through different "lenses": people more inclined to be define as Liberals tend to give more importance to features such as Harm and Care, whereas people self-labeled as Conservatives aggregate Ingroup, Loyalty and Purity dimensions to the first 2. We reproduced this result in [@fig:4zeitgeists]
