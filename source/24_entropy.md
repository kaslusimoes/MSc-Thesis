## Entropy and Inference {#sec:entropy}

Entropy has always been an elusive concept to physicists [@Jaynes1965; @Jaynes1980]. Starting with [@Jaynes1957; @Jaynes1957a] an understanding of entropy as a tool for making inferences about the world has began. After some developments [@Shore1980; @Skilling1988] in the theory of Maximum Entropy (ME), now we seem to be reaching a point in which people can derive more complex physics theories as an application of the ME formalism [@Caticha2017a]. Here we follow mainly the presentation from [@Caticha2012; @Caticha2017b] to expose this ME theory.
