## Social Pressure {#sec:socialpressure}

Human beings are social [@Baumeister1995]. Consciously being excluded from social settings can cause humans to shift neural resources into conflict detection mechanisms in order to revert the social awkwardness. [@Xu2016]
<!-- "exclusion causes people to rebalance attention allocation priorities for cognitive control according to a more flexible and adaptive strategy" -->

The sensation of being cast outside a social group is known by EVERYBODY?. Although this is an unexceptional fact from everyday life, it is also backed up with scientific evidence

WE FEEL PAIN WHEN BEING SOCIALLY REJECTED

Reinforcement Learning [maybe @Yeung2004]

We also have evidence from PSYCHOLOGY? that people tend to learn from each other in order to conform more with the group bla bla [see? @Asch1956; @Sherif1937]

Social Pressure (Group Pressure?)

"Self-categorization can be a crucial determining factor in social influence" [@Abrams1990], (which makes sense because i want to know in which category i am to know in whom should i believe and to whom i must conform)
