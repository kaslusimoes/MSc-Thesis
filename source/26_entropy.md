## Entropy and Inference {#sec:entropy}

Entropy has always been an elusive concept to physicists [@somerandomphysics]. Starting with [@Jaynes1957; @Jaynes1957a] an understanding of entropy as a tool for making inferences about the world has began. After several developments [@Shore1980; @Skilling1988; @who] we seem to reaching a point in which whole Physics theories can be derived as a Maximum Entropy (ME) model [@Caticha2017a]. Here we follow mainly the presentation from [@Caticha2012].
