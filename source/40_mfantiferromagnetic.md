One can note that in the previous MF analysis we only explore values of mistrust between $0$ and $0.5$. That is because for values of $\varepsilon > 0.5$ the society enters a frustrated state which cannot be resolved aligning nor anti-aligning the opinions. This problem is known for a long time on infinite-range Ising models and can be solved separating the Ising variables into 2 groups which have ferromagnetic interactions within them and antiferromagnetic ones between elements of different the groups.

In this section we will show how another MF model can be extended using the same reasoning deployed to solve the bipartite antiferromagnetic Ising model.
