Human beings are social [@Baumeister1995] and adaptive beings. Here we show some psychological and neurological evidence to support that claim. This is important because it give us reason to believe that we can model, at least to some extent, people's interaction in society and their learning from peers and mistakes.

### Psychology: Conformity and Group Categorization {#sec:psychconformity}

For many the pioneer of social psychology experiments, Sherif dedicated himself to the study of _attitudes_ and _social influence_. In particular, one of his first articles studied what he called  "the daily phenomena of suggestion (â€¦) in the formation of attitudes" [@Sherif1937 pg. 98]. On that experiment participants had to perform the same visual task twice: at the first trial they did it in pairs; and individually, in a second trial.

What Sherif noted was twofold:

- During the first trial, there is a norm (standard) and a range of responses that are established within the group, and subjects typically update their responses to conform to the group;
- This conformity is retained when the subject comes back to the second trial, several days later, showing that this kind of influence has lasting effects on the subject.

So far several clarifications and further results have been obtained as well. We present some of those for completeness of this exposition

First, [@Deutsch1955] makes a distinction between 2 kinds of influences: _"normative"_ ("influence to conform with the positive expectations of another") and _"informational"_ ("an influence to accept information obtained from another as evidence about reality"). This distinction is important because we can have settings in which subjects do not feel as belonging to a particular group - therefore they are not subject to a normative influence - and yet they can be influenced in an "informational" way when they consider their peers to be a "trustworthy source of information about the objective reality". [^psychwiki]

Around the same time, [@Asch1956] set out to study the effect of _majorities_ on the opinion of other participants of a group. They performed a visual task with groups of 7-9 individuals, of which only one had not met previously with the experimenter. Those, called confederates, were set respond the task with a previously established strategy: the idea was that the majority could, after setting a baseline of trust with correct answers, dissuade the subject to give an incorrect answer. The results obtained were mixed: as Asch puts it, "the performances ranged from complete independence to complete acquiescence", and "one-third of the minority estimates were distorted toward the majority".

To give one last perspective, [@Abrams1990] gathered experimental setups from several authors (Sherif and Asch among them) and studied those setups giving a closer look to _categorization_ (self and of others). Their study showed how the membership of some subject's peers modulated the influence they had on the subject's response. Amidst other things, they concluded that, for both informational and normative influences, _self-categorization_ had a crucial contribution to the conformity behaviour. In other words: defining the group to which I belong and realizing my peers belong to the same group (or do not) are necessary to make me trust them and take their opinions for granted (or not).

### Neuroscience: Social Exclusion and Error Correcting {#sec:neuroexclusion}

We also have evidence from neuroscience [@Eisenberger2003] explaining how is it that _social pain_ [^socialpain] experiences recruit the same neural machinery employed during physical pain ones. Several participants had to play a virtual game in which they experienced being socially rejected by other peers in 2 different situations: first in an implicit event and then an explicit exclusion scenario. In both cases the researches found a distinguished fMRI signal in two regions: dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (_dACC_) and right ventral prefrontal cortex (_RVPFC_).

In fact, growing number of research is surfacing the importance of this interplay between physical and social distress. [@Eisenberger2004] says that social support in humans even "increases tolerance to electric shock stimulation [@Buck1972] and decreases levels of self-repeated pain during cold-pressor task [@Brown2003]". A recent review by [@Eisenberger2012] analyses those claims in more depth and has pointers to further evidence for the interested reader.

On a side note, researchers have observed [@Gehring1993] that after subjects committed errors in a choice task there was consistently present a signal dubbed error-related negativity (_ERN_). There have been extensive experimental [@Braver2001] and theoretical [@Holroyd2002; @Yeung2004] study to understand where the signal comes from and to model the behaviour of the system in a comprehensible way. Some of the results obtained by the references above show that the _ACC_ is one of the brain areas essential to generate these ERN signals.

For historical accounts of the development of these ideas (and also great reviews), one can see [@Gehring2018; @Dehaene2018].

We present these studies on brain's error-correcting mechanisms in this subsection because there is a connect between them and the studies of social exclusion: both have the _ACC_ in common and both deal with situations in which the human brain is dedicated to changing one's perspective and adapt.
