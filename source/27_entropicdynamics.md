MAYBE PUT SOME OF THIS IN AN APPENDIX?

<!-- Well, at least entropic dynamics of societies! Others have done this, such as [see @Alves2016; @Ipek2018] -->

Finally we describe the idea of Entropic Dynamics of Societies of Agents. This work has been presented in other places [see, e.g. @Alves2015] and have since been expanded by Nestor Caticha and Felippe Alves in work yet to be published.

One can see the full derivation in [@sec:appendix]
