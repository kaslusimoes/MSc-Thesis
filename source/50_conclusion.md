# Conclusion and Perspectives {#sec:ch:conclusion}

My work is nice. I found *this* of interesting and stepped into *that* problem. Future perspectives indicate that we could have done *that* way, and maybe *this* is also a good idea for a new project.

Maybe the division could be only: Discussion/Interpretation (what's the difference) and Future Directions

## Discussion of the results

## Interpretation of the results

## Final Remarks

Ideas for the future:

- For example, [@Alves2018] have shown that when the number of issues being discussed increases beyond the dimensionality of the space, $K$, the society enters a state similar to a glassy phase;
- We could also do the inference $P(g|loc, pa, Q)$ and try to generalize something about the countries, the political groups and the questions (higher g, higher tightness all other fix);
- Some other things I forgot
