The results obtained in [@sec:background] can give rise to several different models and predictions, three of which we show in this chapter. Our main goal is to understand more of how humans interact in society, with an emphasis in understanding group formation, categorization and description of different political groups and gauging the importance of the issues being discussed in the society.

The first model ([@sec:meanfield]) presented is a mean field approximation to a canonical distribution defined by the potential described in [@eq:freeenergy]. We will obtain, in section [@sec:mfresults], a phase transition between an ordered and a disordered phase. This result was already known by [@Vicente2009a; @Vicente2014], and we shown a different approach employing entropic dynamics to obtain the expected outcome.

The second model ([@sec:zeitgeistandextremism]) changes perspective to a simpler model, studied by [@Vicente2014], we can use to compare with empirical data from the MFQ [@Graham2013; @Haidt2007]. We present the assumptions made to link the data with the model, and the inference steps needed to estimate some parameters of the model from the questionnaire. This second study is motivated by the following questions: Are all extremists the same? Are conservative people more extremists than liberal ones? How can we characterize those groups?

Finally, the third model ([@sec:mfantiferromagnetic]) extends the previous one to a setting in which we have two opposing parties that can or cannot have antiferromagnetic interactions. This model presents an interesting interplay between the struggle to have a cohesive group and to oppose the foe group.
