## Moral Foundations {#sec:moralfoundations}

Hardest of all is to define which topics on humanities I will discourse.

I think it is worth a subsection to talk about Moral Foundations, but it depends on the direction my dissertation will follow.. I will leave this as it is as a placeholder for *humanities* topics, but I still need to think this through. (Also, what about Gelfand's tightness measure?)
