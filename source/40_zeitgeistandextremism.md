# Zeitgeist and extremism in Societies {#sec:zeitgeistandextremism}

In [@Vicente2014] was introduced the following interaction hamiltonian in a society:

$$  \mathcal{H} = - \frac{1+\delta}{2} \sum_{\langle ij \rangle} h_i h_j + \frac{1-\delta}{2} \sum_{\langle ij \rangle} |h_i h_j| $$ {#eq:hamiltonianvisujeca}

where $\delta$ is a \textit{psychological cost} of agreement between agents. When $\delta = 0$ the agents are called "error correctors", because they do not change their moral vectors in the case of matching opinions, and when $\delta = 1$ they are called "corroboration seekers", because they attribute the same amount of information to both cases: agreement or disagreement.

In the same paper, the authors developed a mean-field approximation using [@eq:hamiltonianvisujeca] and the Maximum Entropy method. The constraint that the energy is conserved $\mean{\mathcal{H}} = E$ enforces the appearance of a Lagrange multiplier $\beta$, the "social pressure" of the society. The resulting distribution is:

$$  P_{\mathrm{MF}}(h) = \frac{\gamma^2}{2} (1-h^2)\ e^{-\gamma\left(1-h\right)} $$ {#eq:mfvisujeca}

where $\gamma$ is a parameter aggregating $\beta$ and $\delta$. Similarly to [@eq:meanfieldfinal], here $h$ is also the dot product of the agent's inner moral representation $\student$ and a discussed query (\textit{Zeitgeist}) $\xx$.

This second study is motivated by the following questions: Are all extremists the same? Are conservative people more extremists than liberal ones? How can we characterize those groups?
