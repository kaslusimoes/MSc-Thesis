The results obtained in [@sec:background] can give rise to several different models and predictions, three of which we show in this chapter. Our main goal is to understand more about how humans interact in society, with an emphasis in understanding group formation, assessing the possibility of categorizing and describing different political groups and gauging the importance of the issues being discussed in the society.

The first model presented ([@sec:meanfield]) is a mean field approximation to a canonical distribution defined by the potential described in [@eq:freeenergy]. We obtain, in section [@sec:mfresults], a phase transition between an ordered and a disordered phase. This result was already known by [@Vicente2009a; @Vicente2014] using similar models, and we shown a different approach employing entropic dynamics to obtain the expected outcome.

The second model ([@sec:zeitgeistandextremism]) changes perspective to a simpler model studied by [@Vicente2014]. We compare predictions of this model with empirical data from the MFQ [@Graham2013; @Haidt2007]. We present the assumptions made to link the data with the model, and the inference steps needed to estimate some parameters of the model from the questionnaire. From this model we try to characterize different political groups, such as conservatives and liberals, and we also develop the concept of extremists.

Finally, the third model ([@sec:mfantiferromagnetic]) extends the previous one to a setting in which we have two opposing parties that can have an antiferromagnetic interaction between them. This model presents an interesting interplay between having a cohesive "friends" group and opposing the "foes" group.
