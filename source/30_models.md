The results shown in [@sec:entropicdynamics] can give rise to several different models and predictions, three of which we present in this chapter. Our main goal is to understand more about how humans interact in society, with an emphasis in understanding group formation, assessing the possibility of categorizing and describing different political groups and gauging the importance of the issues being discussed in a society.

The first model we shall present ([@sec:meanfield]) is a mean field approximation to a canonical distribution defined by the potential described in [@eq:freeenergy]. We obtain, in [@sec:mfresults], a phase transition between an ordered and a disordered phase. This result was already known by [@Vicente2009a; @Vicente2014] using similar models, and we shown a different approach employing entropic dynamics to obtain the expected outcome.

This model yields some interesting results regarding the phase transition between ordered and disordered societies, but it has two major drawbacks:

1. It is too intractable to enable us perform reasonable comparisons with available data;
2. It cannot account for the existence of opposite and polarized groups without resorting to additional hypothesis.

Henceforth, in the other subsections we analyze alternative models based on the one presented in [@sec:zeitgeistandextremism; and @sec:mfantiferromagnetic]  that could also account for those 2 points.
<!-- Both models are built taking into consideration efforts made in [@Vicente2014] -->

<!-- Henceforth, in the other subsections we analyze alternative models based on the one presented in Vicente et al. 2014 that could also account for those 2 points. The first one consists of an analysis of the large dataset built by [@Graham2013] containing the responses to a set of questions about moral issues from $N \sim \mathcal{O}(10^5)$ persons from several countries. The second one is a saddle-point approximation to a bipartite society model with possibility of antiferromagnetic interactions between the 2 groups. -->

The second model shifts the perspective to a simpler model studied by [@Vicente2014]. We compare predictions of this model with empirical data from the MFQ [@Graham2009; @Graham2013; @Haidt2007]. We present the assumptions made to bridge some gaps between data and model, and the inference steps needed to estimate, from the questionnaire, some parameters of the model. From this model we also try to characterize different political groups, such as conservatives and liberals, and we present the concept of extremists.

<!-- The first one analyzes the importance of the questions being discussed by the agents in a given society, comparing with data from Moral Foundation group of [@Graham2009]. This study is motivated by the following questions: Are all extremists the same? Are conservative people more extremists than liberal ones? How can we characterize those groups?; -->

Finally, the third model extends the previous one to a setting in which we have two opposing parties that can have an antiferromagnetic interaction between them. This model presents an interesting interplay between having a cohesive "friends" group and opposing the "foes" group.
<!-- We will see that it becomes possible to extend the level of noise between agents $\varepsilon$ to values not reachable in [@sec:meanfield]. -->

<!-- The second study is a bipartite society model in which we have ferromagnetic interactions inside each group, and possibly antiferromagnetic interactions between agents of the two groups. -->
