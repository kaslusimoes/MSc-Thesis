## Outline {#sec:outline}

[@sec:background] is a background on the topics relevant to this study. We start talking about the studies in psychology and neuroscience that give support and substrate to our investigation. Then we present the different, but matching (?), tools we use in our study, namely: probability theory, entropic dynamics and statistical physics. Finally, we explain the reasons we have to believe that what can be called a "social sciences problem" can be posed as a physics, or inference, problem using the tools presented.

In [@sec:models] we present three different models that we constructed to investigate our hypothesis, presenting the results in [@sec:results] and the discussion in [@sec:conclusion].
