Outlining the outline of the outlines

The first model yields some interesting results regarding the phase transition between ordered and disordered societies, but it has two major drawbacks:
1. It is too intractable to enable us perform reasonable comparisons with available data;
2. It cannot account for the existence of opposite and polarized groups.

Henceforth, in the other subsections we analyze alternative models based on the one presented in Vicente et al. 2014 that could also account for those 2 points. The first one consists of an analysis of the large dataset built by [@Graham2013] containing the responses to a set of questions about moral issues from $N \sim \mathcal{O}(10^5)$ persons from several countries. The second one is a saddle-point approximation to a bipartite society model with possibility of antiferromagnetic interactions between the 2 groups.

we present two different studies:

- The first one analyzes the importance of the questions being discussed by the agents in a given society, comparing with data from Moral Foundation group of [@Graham2009]. This study is motivated by the following questions: Are all extremists the same? Are con-
servative people more extremists than liberal ones? How can we characterize those groups?;
- The second study is a bipartite society model in which we have ferromagnetic interactions inside each group, and possibly antiferromagnetic interactions between agents of the two groups.
