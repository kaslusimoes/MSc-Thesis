## Outline {#sec:outline}

[@sec:ch:background] provides an introductory background to the topics relevant to this study. We start talking about the studies in psychology and neuroscience that form the substrate of our investigation and give support to our hypothesis. Then we present the quantitative tools we use in our study, namely: probability theory, entropic dynamics and statistical physics. Finally, we explain the reasons we have to believe that questions usually called "social sciences' problem" can be posed, using the tools presented, as a physics problem.

In [@sec:ch:models] we present three different models that we constructed to investigate our hypothesis, presenting the results in [@sec:ch:results] and the discussion in [@sec:ch:conclusion].
