Here we describe the main tools and ideas being used to study the questions proposed in [@sec:ch:introduction].

As told, there has been many enterprises to study the mentioned problems and also others related. Some of the research areas that are more aligned with our interests are those of (social) psychology and (cognitive) neuroscience. We also present some developments in bayesian inference (probability theory) and entropic inference, which form the solid ground of our models, together with statistical mechanics and some concepts from machine learning.
