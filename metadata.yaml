abstract: We model a society of agents who interact in pairs by exchanging for/against opinions about issues using a perceptron algorithm. Employing a maximum entropy analysis one can describe the interacting pair as a dynamics along the gradient of the logarithm of the evidence. This permits introducing an energy like quantity and an approximate global hamiltonian. Knowledge of the expected value of the hamiltonian is relevant information for the state of the society, inducing a canonical distribution by maximum entropy. We study the phase diagram of the society using a mean field approximation which indicate a phase transitions separating ordered and disordered phases depending on the society parameters.
