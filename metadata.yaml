    This project deals with the study of the learning dynamics of agents in a society. For that we employ techniques from statistical mechanics, machine learning and probability theory. Agents interact in pairs by exchanging for/against opinions about issues using a perceptron algorithm. Employing a maximum entropy analysis one can describe the interacting pair as a dynamics along the gradient of the logarithm of the evidence. This permits introducing a energy like quantities and approximate global Hamiltonians. We test different hypothesis having in mind the weaknesses and predictive power of each one. Knowledge of the expected value of the Hamiltonian is relevant information for the state of the society, inducing a canonical distribution by maximum entropy. The results are interpreted with the usual tools from statistical mechanics and thermodynamics.

    Some of the questions we discuss are a assessing the existence of phase transitions separating ordered and disordered phases depending on the society parameters; an assessing how the issue being discussed by the agents influences the outcomes of the discussion, and how this reflects in the overall organization of the group; and an study of the possible different interactions between opposing parties and to which extent disagreement affects the overall cohesiveness of the society, having the discussed question fixed.
