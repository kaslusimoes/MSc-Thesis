# MSc Thesis

I'm writing this thesis (or _dissertation_, not sure why) in order to obtain my Master in Physics from the University of SÃ£o Paulo. This should have some overlap with other repos on my github but less code and (hopefully) better explained.

Broadly speaking, my work could be described as an use of __inferential tools__ (bayesian \& entropic methods, statistical physics as well) to develop models about how people reason on moral issues and exchange opinions with their peers in society. Our (me, my [adviser](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=L8JJ5dgAAAAJ) and our group) models are influenced by [learning of perceptrons](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0305-4470/25/23/020/meta), [Moral Foundations Theory](http://www.moralfoundations.org/) and MaxEnt/Entropic Dynamics (a nice introduction is given Ariel Caticha [here](https://www.albany.edu/physics/ACaticha-EIFP-book.pdf))
