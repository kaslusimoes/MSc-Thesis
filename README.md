# MSc Dissertation

I'm writing this dissertation in order to obtain my Master in Physics from the University of São Paulo. This should have some overlap with other repos on my github but less code and (hopefully) better explained.

I've worked my way into writing this dissertation using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)+[Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/)+LaTeX/BibTex+what-else-is-needed. For that, I'm studying some other efforts along similar lines, such as [tompollard/phd_thesis_markdown](https://github.com/tompollard/phd_thesis_markdown) and [chiakaivalya/thesis-markdown-pandoc](https://github.com/chiakaivalya/thesis-markdown-pandoc).

Those are really nice references! (But it has not been easy)

## Open Science

I need to post the code I used (`julia version 0.6.4`) to generate each figure in the dissertation. If, for some obscure reason I forgot to do that, feel free to ask me!

They should be inside the `code/` folder.

## Research

Broadly speaking, my work could be described as an use of __inferential tools__ (bayesian \& entropic methods, statistical physics as well) to develop models about __how people reason on moral issues and exchange opinions with their peers in society__. Our <sup>1</sup> models are influenced by [learning of perceptrons](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0305-4470/25/23/020/meta), [Moral Foundations Theory](http://www.moralfoundations.org/) and MaxEnt/Entropic Dynamics (a nice introduction is given by Ariel Caticha [here](https://www.albany.edu/physics/ACaticha-EIFP-book.pdf)).

If you'd like to, feel free to send me an email.
