# MSc Dissertation

I'm writing this dissertation in order to obtain my Master in Physics from the University of SÃ£o Paulo. This should have some overlap with other repos on my github but less code and (hopefully) better explained.

I've worked my way into writing this dissertation using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)+[Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/)+LaTeX/BibTex+what-else-is-needed. For that, I'm studying some other efforts along similar lines, such as [tompollard/phd_thesis_markdown](https://github.com/tompollard/phd_thesis_markdown) and [chiakaivalya/thesis-markdown-pandoc](https://github.com/chiakaivalya/thesis-markdown-pandoc).

Those are really nice references! (But it has not been easy)

## Open Science

I need to post the code I used to generate each figure in the dissertation. If, for some obscure reason I forgot to do that, feel free to ask me!

They should be inside the `code/` folder.

## Research

Broadly speaking, my work could be described as an use of __inferential tools__ (bayesian \& entropic methods, statistical physics as well) to develop models about __how people reason on moral issues and exchange opinions with their peers in society__. Our [^group] models are influenced by [learning of perceptrons](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0305-4470/25/23/020/meta), [Moral Foundations Theory](http://www.moralfoundations.org/) and MaxEnt/Entropic Dynamics (a nice introduction is given by Ariel Caticha [here](https://www.albany.edu/physics/ACaticha-EIFP-book.pdf)).

If you'd like to, feel free to send me an email.
