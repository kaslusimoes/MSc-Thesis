Summary {#sec:summary}
=======

We model a society of agents who interact in pairs by exchanging
for/against opinions about issues using a perceptron algorithm.
Employing a maximum entropy analysis one can describe the interacting
pair as a dynamics along the gradient of the logarithm of the evidence.
This permits introducing an energy like quantity and an approximate
global hamiltonian. Knowledge of the expected value of the hamiltonian
is relevant information for the state of the society, inducing a
canonical distribution by maximum entropy. We study the phase diagram of
the society using a mean field approximation which indicate a phase
transitions separating ordered and disordered phases depending on the
society parameters.
